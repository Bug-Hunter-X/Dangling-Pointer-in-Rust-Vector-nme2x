This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving dangling pointers when modifying a vector after creating a reference to one of its elements. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version illustrating how to avoid this issue.  This example is crucial for understanding memory management in Rust and the importance of avoiding data races and undefined behavior.
